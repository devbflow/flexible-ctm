# Config document
# This is used to configure the entire process, which components to use etc.
# With this config, it is easier to change and compare experimental setups.
#
# A side effect of using a config as pivot point is the hard dependency on it.
# Adding/removing features requires changes in the code, so to make that easier,
# there are indicators for where the respective parts of this config are used.
#
# This config is supposed to be well readable and easy to understand,
# hence the longer names.
