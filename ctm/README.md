# The Category Traversal Module (CTM)

The CTM is a module for few-shot metric-learners, that, as opposed to common practice, pays attention to the entirety of the support set.
It learns distinct discriminative features for a given support set given a K-shot N-way setting.
These features can then be given to a metric-learner for improved metric-learning by accounting for the given support set.
