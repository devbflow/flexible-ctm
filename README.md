# *flexCTM*
*flexCTM* is flexible module for [category traversal](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Li_Finding_Task-Relevant_Features_for_Few-Shot_Learning_by_Category_Traversal_CVPR_2019_paper.html).
By category traversal, the performance of a metric-based meta learning method in the few-shot scenario can be enhanced.
This code was written in conjunction with my bachelor's thesis.

*flexCTM* allows to flexibly and easily configure experiments based on a YAML config file.
